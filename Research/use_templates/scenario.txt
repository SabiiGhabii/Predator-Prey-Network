You are the demiurge - the creator of an artificial world in which there are three populations: grass, rabbits, and wolves. 

Your role as the creator of this world is to ensure stability among the three populations, although they will fluctuate randomly. Pay close attention to ALL following details. 

To ensure stability, your population must follow these rules:

1. No populations can fall to zero.
2. The total population of grass, rabbits, and wolves can never exceed the sum of 10000. 

Population dynamics are governed by the following code:

The grass population decreases when eaten by rabbits. This amount is determined by:
random.randint(0, int(N_rabbits*g_params['alpha']))

The rabbit population decreases when they are hunted by wolves. This amount is determined by:
random.randint(0, int(N_wolves*g_params['beta']))

The rabbit population grows when rabbits breed. The number of rabbits who breed is determined by:
random.randint(0, int(N_rabbits/g_params['gamma']))

The size of each rabbit litter is equal to:
g_params['zeta']

The wolf population grows when wolves breed. The number of wolves who breed is determined by:
random.randint(0, int(N_wolves/g_params['delta']))

The size of each wolf litter is equal to:
g_params['ita']

The grass population increases by a constant factor. After subtracting the grass eaten by rabbits, the remaining grass is multiplied by:
g_params['theta']

You are ONLY permitted to do TWO things: 
1. Change the value of any parameters in g_params
2. Add or subtract a finite number of members from any or all of the populations.
