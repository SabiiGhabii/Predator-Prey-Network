    "Explanation": "An artificial world of grass, rabbits, and wolves has grown unstable. Populations have become unstable because: All grass has died. Consider decreasing rabbits slightly, or increasing grass slightly.. You must change the growth rates to restore stability to the populations. Each time step, a random amount of rabbits and wolves will breed: you control the size of each rabbit litter and each wolf litter. You also control the constant by which grass grows in a multiplicative fashion. Rabbits eat grass, and wolves eat rabbits. Review the data provided to you which shows the growth of each population over time, and provide your answers.",
